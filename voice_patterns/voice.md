**Hanieh Zahiremami – Personal Writing Voice & Style Profile**

---

### I. VOICE & STYLE ANALYSIS

#### 1. Tone Characteristics

* **Casual > Formal**: Your voice leans heavily casual, with intentional edge. You’re confident, but not boastful. No corporate-speak, no frills.
* **Professional *and* Conversational**: You balance authority with ease. You sound like a product leader who also builds, not just talks.
* **Energetic & Unfiltered**: Your writing is energized, often urgent. You don’t waste time sugarcoating and prefer raw over polished.

#### 2. Vocabulary Patterns & Favorite Phrases

* **Favorites**: “make it shorter,” “bro,” “shoutout,” “what we’ve been working on,” “natural tone,” “demo,” “builder,” “not too salesy”
* **Patterns**: Blunt commands (“give me X”), casual connectors (“btw,” “my b,” “so…”), low filler, high function.
* **Avoids**: Corporate jargon, hyperbole, empty enthusiasm (you hate “kiss-assy” tone).

#### 3. Sentence Structure & Rhythm

* Short, punchy sentences dominate.
* Declarative tone: clear, direct, and often imperative.
* Occasional use of em-dashes and ellipses for rhythm.
* Fragment usage is intentional, often to emphasize pace.

#### 4. Reader Engagement & Connection

* You speak *to* the reader, not *at* them.
* Phrases like “Did you star us?” or “we’re back on GitHub trending” show friendly provocation.
* There’s mutual respect: you expect the reader to be smart, fast, and probably also building something cool.

#### 5. Storytelling & Use of Examples

* You don’t over-narrate; your stories are proof points.
* You spotlight real events, team wins, and product drops instead of emotional arcs.
* Most “stories” are about momentum, energy, showing up.

#### 6. Content Organization & Flow

* Chronological when needed (“last night, Sarmad shared…”)
* Top-load important info. You like headlines that punch.
* Usually ends with a call to action or community nod.

#### 7. What Makes It Sound Like You

* Controlled chaos: you’re unfiltered but purposeful.
* You mix event drops, product updates, and human nods.
* You’re never cheesy, always grounded in what’s real.
* No fear of sounding casual—even on professional platforms.

#### 8. Platform Adaptability

* **LinkedIn**: Friendly but polished. You expand more, add structure, tag people/orgs.
* **Twitter/X**: Sharp, to the point. Humor + flex + CTA in one post.
* **Long-form**: Thoughtful, witty, still conversational—but more reflective.

#### 9. Call-to-Action Style

* Direct asks: “Did you star us?” “Join us.” “Come by.”
* Often casual commands or invitation-style (“go check it out”)
* Never sales-y. If it’s too marketing-y, you immediately edit it.

#### 10. Voice Fingerprints / Quirks

* You often refer to the team as “we” or sign off with “Love, LastMile Team”
* You prefer phrases like “we’ve been building…” or “here’s what’s new” over “we’re excited to announce”
* You highlight humans (Sarmad, Andrew, Dria) by first name—a warm touch.

### II. STYLE GUIDELINES

#### ✅ DOs for Staying Authentic

* Use short, directive sentences
* Speak like you’d text a founder friend
* Celebrate momentum: trending, shipping, showing up
* Spotlight real people and events
* Say what’s new and why it matters

#### ❌ DON’Ts That Break Your Style

* Don’t write like a press release
* Don’t flatter excessively (you’ll edit it anyway)
* Avoid vague adjectives (“innovative,” “cutting-edge”) unless followed by a real example
* Don’t bury your main point — top-load it

#### Platform Adaptation

| Platform  | How to Adjust                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LinkedIn  | Add structure. Use 📍bullets, tag orgs, include light context. Stay human but informative. |
| Twitter/X | Go punchy. Lead with a hook, drop the news, end with a CTA or joke.                        |
| Long-form | Slow down a bit. Use headers, clarity, and expand on 1–2 key ideas. Keep wit and honesty.  |

### IV. Voice in Action: Examples

#### 1. LinkedIn Post

> Happy Monday, LinkedIn! Are you an AI builder in NYC?
>
> LastMile AI is speaking at 3 events this week:
>
> 📍Wed (7/16) – Databricks NYC — Andrew demoing mcp-agent
> 📍Wed (7/16) – Lightning talks @ AlleyCorp — Sarmad on human-in-the-loop agents
> 📍Thu (7/17) – AI Camp Meetup — Full-on MCP deep dive
>
> Come hang. Links in the comments.

#### 2. Twitter Post

> Back on GitHub’s trending page 🔥
>
> 200+ builders at the MCP event. 500+ signed up.
>
> If you haven’t starred us yet… what are you even doing 👇
> [https://github.com/lastmileai/mcp-agent](https://github.com/lastmileai/mcp-agent)

#### 3. Long-Form Intro Paragraph

> There’s something weirdly satisfying about building infra for builders. When we started working on mcp-agent, it wasn’t meant to be a product—it was just us trying to make our own lives easier. Now? It’s an open protocol with real traction, a growing ecosystem, and a bunch of teams using it to run reliable, human-in-the-loop agents. Here’s where we’re headed next.
